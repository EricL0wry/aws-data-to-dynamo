Two $$word01$$, both alike in dignity, in fair $$word02$$, where we lay our scene. From ancient $$word03$$ break to new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star-cross'd $$word04$$ take their life. Whole misadventured piteous overthrows do with their $$word05$$ bury their parents' strife. The fearful passage of their $$word06$$ love, and the continuance of their parents` rage, which, but their children's end, nought could $$word07$$, is now the $$word08$$ hours' traffic of our stage. The which if you with $$word09$$ $$word10$$ attend, what here shall $$word11$$, our toil shall strive to mend.
