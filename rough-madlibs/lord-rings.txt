In J.R.R. Tolkien's famous trilogy, Lord of the $$word01$$s, the first book is called Fellowship of the $$word01$$. In this book a group of $$word02$$ Hobbits flee their hometown. They eventually join into a fellowship made up of $$word03$$, Elves and $$word04$$, with the goal of $$word05$$ the One $$word01$$. They begin by traveling through the $$word06$$ mountains, where $$word07$$ the $$word08$$ is lost. They continue on to the forest, where the queen of the $$word09$$ gives them $$word10$$ to ride down the river. At the end of the book, Merri and Pippin get captured by $$word11$$, and Frodo is $$word12$$ one of his fellow $$word13$$ and leaves on his own (but with Sam).
